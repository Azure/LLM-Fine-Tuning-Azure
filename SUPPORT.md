## Using GitHub Projects for Kanban Board Task Management

GitHub provides a built-in **Projects** feature that allows you to manage tasks using a Kanban board. This is the recommended way to organize and track work in this repository.

### What is GitHub Projects?

GitHub Projects is an integrated project management tool that provides flexible views including:
- **Kanban boards** with customizable columns
- **Table views** for detailed task tracking
- **Roadmap views** for timeline planning
- Integration with Issues and Pull Requests

### Setting Up a Kanban Board with GitHub Projects

#### 1. Create a New Project

1. Navigate to the repository: `https://github.com/Azure/LLM-Fine-Tuning-Azure`
2. Click on the **Projects** tab at the top of the repository
3. Click **New project** (or **Link a project** if you want to use an existing one)
4. Choose a template:
   - **Board**: Classic Kanban-style board view (recommended for task management)
   - **Table**: Spreadsheet-like view
   - **Roadmap**: Timeline view for planning
5. Give your project a name (e.g., "LLM Fine-Tuning Tasks")
6. Click **Create project**

#### 2. Customize Your Kanban Board

The default board comes with columns like:
- **Todo**: Tasks that need to be done
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Done**: Completed tasks

You can customize columns by:
1. Click the **+** icon to add new columns
2. Click on column names to rename them
3. Drag and drop columns to reorder them
4. Common column names: `Backlog`, `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`

#### 3. Add Tasks to Your Board

You can add tasks in several ways:

**Option A: Create Draft Issues**
1. Click **+ Add item** in any column
2. Type a task title and press Enter
3. Convert to a full issue later if needed

**Option B: Create Full Issues**
1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository
2. Click **New issue**
3. Fill in the issue title, description, labels, and assignees
4. The issue will automatically appear in your project

**Option C: Add Existing Issues**
1. Click **+ Add item** in any column
2. Search for existing issues by typing `#` followed by the issue number
3. Select the issue to add it to your board

#### 4. Manage Tasks

- **Move tasks**: Drag and drop cards between columns as work progresses
- **Assign tasks**: Click on a card and assign team members
- **Add labels**: Use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation` to categorize tasks
- **Set priorities**: Use labels or custom fields to indicate priority
- **Track progress**: View project insights and burn-down charts

### GitHub Projects vs. Wiki vs. Issues

| Feature | Projects | Issues | Wiki |
|---------|----------|--------|------|
| **Kanban Board** | ✅ Yes (Primary use case) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Task Tracking** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Visual Organization** | ✅ Yes (Board, Table, Roadmap) | ⚠️ Limited (List view) | ❌ No |
| **Collaboration** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Documentation** | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Yes (Primary use case) |
| **Best For** | Project management, Kanban boards | Bug tracking, feature requests | Long-form documentation |

**Recommendation**: Use **GitHub Projects** for Kanban board task management. It provides the best visual workflow and integrates seamlessly with Issues and Pull Requests.

### Best Practices

1. **Keep tasks atomic**: Each card should represent a single, actionable task
2. **Use labels**: Categorize tasks with labels like `priority:high`, `type:bug`, `area:documentation`
3. **Regular updates**: Move cards as you progress to keep the board accurate
4. **Link related items**: Link issues to pull requests for better traceability
5. **Archive completed tasks**: Periodically clean up the "Done" column to reduce clutter
6. **Use milestones**: Group related issues under milestones for release planning
